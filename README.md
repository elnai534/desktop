This project creates a desktop pet using Python and Tkinter. The pet features animated movements, can respond to user clicks with different animations, and is draggable around the desktop. 
The application is packaged as a Windows executable (.exe) for global access and easy use.

Animations: Idle, Kiss, and Wave animations are included.
Transparency: The pet appears with a fully transparent background while retaining its full opacity.
Draggable: Users can right-click and drag the pet to reposition it anywhere on their desktop.
Customizable: Animation assets can be replaced or updated in the assets folder.

Installation:
Requirements:
Operating System: Windows 10 or later.

Steps to Install:
Download the dist folder containing the executable.
Locate the .exe file (e.g., DesktopPet.exe) inside the dist folder.
Copy the entire dist folder to a desired location on your computer (e.g., C:\Programs\DesktopPet).
Open the folder where you copied the dist folder.
Double-click the .exe file (e.g., DesktopPet.exe) to start the application.

**Note on Windows Security**

When you first run the .exe file, Windows Defender SmartScreen may block the application with a warning such as:
"Windows protected your PC"
This occurs because the application is not digitally signed and the file contains an .exe file.

How to Bypass the Warning:
Click on "More info" in the warning dialog.
Click "Run anyway" to start the application.

Troubleshooting:
Transparent Background is Not Working: Ensure your system supports transparency in applications.
Application is Not Running:
Verify you have copied the entire dist folder and not just the .exe file.
Ensure you are running the application on a compatible Windows version.
